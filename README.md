### RFM segmentation is a great method to identify groups of customers for special treatment. It can be used to get better understanding of customers to improve customer marketing, which in turn could be used to increase the revenue of a company.
  
  - It allows marketers to target specific clusters of customers with communications that are much more relevant for their particular behaviour - and thus generate much higher rate of response, plus increased loyalty and customer lifetime value
  
  - R Recency, F frequency and M monetary.
  
- Recency (R): When was a customer's most recent activity or transaction with the company?

- Frequency (F): How often has a customer transacted or interacted with the brand during a particular period of time?

- Monetary (M): what is the size of the customer's transaction? / How much a customer has spent with the company during a particular period of time?


#### We will use this technique to gain a deeper understanding of the customers, allowing us to ask (and, more importantly, answer) the following important questions:

- How many different RFM segments do we have for users? What are the unique high-level characteristics of each segment? (By answering these questions, we can determine business levers that can be used to maximize revenue for each segment)

- What is the percentage of each RFM segment? (Answering this question helps one to size opportunities)
